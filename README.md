# Learn useEffect Over Lunch

Hi! This repo contains the before & after code for the examples in [Learn useEffect Over Lunch](https://useeffectoverlunch.com), a mini-course all about the useEffect hook.

Feel free to browse through the examples and check out [the course](https://useeffectoverlunch.com) to see how I build them up. It's 7 video lessons (about 48 mins) covering:

* What is a side effect, and why do we need useEffect?
* Fetching Data (and avoiding infinite loops
* Re-fetch data when a prop changes
* Create a custom hook for fetching data
* Refactor lifecycle methods to useEffect
* Websockets, extra dependencies, and the functional fix
* useEffect vs useLayoutEffect, and when to use each
